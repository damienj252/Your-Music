#Single Webpage Application
####Data Representation and Querying Project 2016

This repository contains code for one of my Third year Software Development projects. The module is Data Representation and Querying. 

###Project Overview
I have created a Single-Page Web Application that allows the user store the name of their favorite artists and songs and store them on a database.

In the beginning of this project I found it very difficult to create a webpage that can extend to another webpage that I created but I could not rectify this error so because of this I created a single webpage application with no extensions.

My Project outline are as follows:
>You are required to develop a single-page web application(SPA) written in the programming language Python using the Flask framework. You must devise an idea for a web application, write the software, write documentation explaining how the application works, and write a short user guide for it.

###Attempts
I made many different attempts to create the desired webpage but by the due date I could not rectify the errors. 

###How to run the application
